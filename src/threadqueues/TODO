Make a structure
also figure out a way to make nulled functions a no-op.

Need to define initializers.
     
figure out how to deal with nulled function pointers.

so for those guyes it's

To make the ifdefs go away.

Need to reference glibc and other gnu libs to see the difference between how they initialize and set flags. Particularly nptl.

so that is interestinign.
so you have to free a threadqueue.
so is taht what you really want?

We can get the state.
what else are we doing here?

So what are

so that is the rcr tool

So I need to set up the initializers.

So you have the pools. The pools can also be the pseudo object oreiented approach.

so the same thing with the spawn cache.
make it a pseudo object. If it's null, then we're fine.

so we have a multi-dequeuer too
handle that later

just handle that ourself.
Make eurekas a runtime flag.

Make all of the functions in the threadqueues static

rename sched to tq
