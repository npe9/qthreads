Separate ifdefs into feature ifdefs, portability ifdefs and other.

See if I can take the portability ifdefs out.

The features are a little funkier. See which features generalize? Eurekas may be relatively simple. You just test for null and see how that works.

We also need to see what the performance differences of this approach are.

Need to move the yielding logic out.
     that is an easy win.
     should allow me to get rid of the ifdef logic in qthread.c as well.

What to do about GUARD_PAGES?

Kill the folds as well.

STACK_GROWS_DOWN behavior should be handled per architecture.

Things like valgrind should be conditional compilation.
